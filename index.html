  <h1>Betty</h1>
  
<body>

  <p>
    She has dark fluffy hair<br>
    And plops around so loud<br>
    You would think her four little feet accounted for a whole crowd<br>
    
    With her loud echoing snore,<br>
    And a stomach that is a bottomless pit<br>
    You're first guess would be wrong,<br>
    No! She is not a wild boar<br>
    
    So, you may wonder<br>
    What could this mystery creature be?<br>
    A Bear?<br>
    A Horse?<br>
    A Yetti?<br>
    
    No,<br>
    She is just the little cockapoo named Betty
